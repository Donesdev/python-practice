# Python Practice 🐍

This repository contains my early Python practice while learning programming fundamentals.

I’m using this repo to:
- Learn Python basics step by step
- Practice writing, running, and debugging code
- Get comfortable using GitHub and version control
- Track my progress over time

## What’s in this repo

- `helloworld.py`  
  A simple interactive script that:
  - Prints messages to the console
  - Takes user input
  - Uses basic conditionals and lists
  - Practices reading and understanding code logic

## What I’m learning

- Variables and data types (strings, integers, lists)
- User input and output
- Conditional logic (`if / else`)
- Writing readable code
- Basic debugging
- Using GitHub (commits, updates, version control)

## Why this repo exists

This is not a finished project — it’s a learning log.  
The goal is consistency and improvement, not perfection.

I’ll continue updating this repo as I learn more Python concepts and build more small scripts.

## Tools

- Python 3
- VS Code
- GitHub

🚀 More updates coming as I keep learning.
